# Node.js Server Deployment on Render

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Node.js server built using the **Express** framework. The server responds to basic HTTP requests and serves as an example of deploying a Node.js application on **Render**, a free hosting provider. The application includes a basic route `/server` that responds with a message confirming the server's functionality.

The live application is accessible at this URL:
[https://nodehosting-2.onrender.com/server](https://nodehosting-2.onrender.com/server)

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **Express.js**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and web applications.
- **Render**: Cloud platform used for deploying and managing web applications and services.

## Deployment
### Steps to Deploy:
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push the Node.js project code to a GitHub repository.
2. **Sign Up on Render**: Create an account on [Render](https://render.com) if you don't already have one.
3. **Deploy the Application**: 
    - Connect your GitHub repository to Render.
    - Alternatively, use the Render CLI to deploy your app.
4. **Configure Environment Variables** (if necessary): For example, set `PORT` to the desired port or allow it to default to Render's configuration.
5. **Start the Application**: Render automatically starts the app once it's deployed. You can monitor logs to debug any issues.

The deployed endpoint can be accessed here:

## Installation

To run this application locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Xoli-Nxiweni/NodeHosting.git
    cd NodeHosting
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the necessary Node.js packages specified in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Server**:
    Start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Access the Application**:
    The server will be running on the specified `PORT` (default is `6060`). You can access it by navigating to:
    ```
    http://localhost:6060/server
    ```

## Usage

This application serves a simple API route to confirm the server is running. The following endpoint is available:

### **GET /server**
- **Description**: Returns a message indicating that the server is operational.

#### Example Request:
```bash
curl http://localhost:6060/server
```

#### Example Response:
```text
Server is up and running!!!
```

To test this route on the deployed version, simply navigate to:
